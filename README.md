# OpenUSD Tutorials and Examples

> ## Note
> Consider enrolling in NVIDIA's free curriculum on the [Deep Learning Institute (DLI)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/learn/learning-path/openusd/) platform for an interactive learning experience.
>
> Designed for developers and 3D practitioners, these courses cover the fundamentals of OpenUSD as well as practical applications. The curriculum offers a structured path from introductory concepts and best practices to advanced topics, equipping participants with the skills needed to confidently apply OpenUSD in real-world workflows.

## About
This project showcases educational material for [Pixar's Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html) (OpenUSD).

For convenience, the Jupyter notebook from the GTC session is available on Google Colaboratory, which offers an interactive environment from the comfort of your web browser. Colaboratory makes it possible to:
 * Try code snippets without building or installing OpenUSD on your machine
 * Run the samples on any device
 * Share code experiments with others

Should you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine instead, simply download and execute it after [installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

## Sample Notebook
Follow along the tutorial using the sample notebook from the GTC session, or get acquainted with OpenUSD using other examples:
