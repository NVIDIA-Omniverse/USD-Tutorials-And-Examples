# OpenUSD Tutorials and Examples

> ## Note
> For interactive learning experiences, consider enrolling in free curriculum for developers and 3D practicioners on [NVIDIA DLI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/learn/learning-path/openusd/).
>
> Courses hosted on the DLI platform cover OpenUSD fundamentals as well as applied concepts, from comprehensive introductions to essential concepts and best practices up to advanced topics preparing developers and creators to use OpenUSD effectively in practical workflows.

## About
This project showcases educational material for [Pixar's Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html) (OpenUSD).

For convenience, the Jupyter notebook from the GTC session is available on Google Colaboratory, which offers an interactive environment from the comfort of your web browser. Colaboratory makes it possible to:
 * Try code snippets without building or installing OpenUSD on your machine
 * Run the samples on any device
 * Share code experiments with others

Should you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine instead, simply download and execute it after [installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

## Sample Notebook
Follow along the tutorial using the sample notebook from the GTC session, or get acquainted with OpenUSD using other examples:
